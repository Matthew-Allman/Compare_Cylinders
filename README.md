# Cylinder Calculator Program

The Cylinder Calculator Program is a console-based application that allows users
to perform various calculations on two circular cylinders, including comparisons, 
lateral surface area, and volume calculation. 
The program also allows users to run it continuously until a sentinel value is entered.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file
and extract it to a directory of your choice.

## Usage

1. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the dimensions of the two cylinders.
2. Choose the calculation you want to perform from the menu.
3. Repeat steps 1-2 as desired.
4. To exit the program, enter the sentinel value.

## Input Validation

The program validates user input to ensure that only positive numbers are entered. 
If the user enters a negative number, the program prompts the user to enter a positive number.
The program also ensures an integer value is entered to avoid errors.

## Comparison
The program allows users to compare the volumes of two cylinders and determine which cylinder has a greater volume.

## Lateral Surface Area Calculation
The program calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder based on the radius and height input by the user.

## Volume Calculation
The program calculates the volume of a cylinder based on the radius and height input by the user.

## Continuous Execution
The program allows users to perform multiple calculations on the same or different cylinders without having to restart the program.

##Sentinel Value
The sentinel value is a special value that the user can enter to exit the program. The default sentinel value is -1, but the user can change it by modifying the SENTINEL constant in the program.
